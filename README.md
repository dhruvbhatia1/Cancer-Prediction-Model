# Cancer-Prediction-Model

Developed a Breast Cancer Prediction Model using SVM algorithm.
The model was trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset, which includes various features describing the characteristics of breast tumors.
After completing the model training and validation, the project achieved an accuracy of 95%, indicating the high potential of the model to accurately predict the presence or absence of breast cancer in patients.
